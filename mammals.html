				<p>Whales are a group of marine mammals that belong to the order Cetacea. They are thought to have evolved from land-dwelling mammals around 50 million years ago and gradually adapted to life in the ocean.

					The earliest known whales were small, four-legged creatures that looked somewhat like modern-day wolves. They had a long snout and sharp teeth, and are thought to have hunted on land and in shallow water. Over time, these early whales began to spend more and more time in the water, eventually losing their legs and developing a streamlined body shape that allowed them to swim efficiently. <a href="whales.html">  Read More...</a></p>

				<p>Sea otters are a type of marine mammal that belongs to the family Mustelidae, which also includes animals such as weasels, badgers, and ferrets. They are native to the coasts of the Pacific Ocean and are found in countries such as the United States, Canada, Russia, and Japan.
					Sea otters are thought to have evolved from land-dwelling mustelids around 5-7 million years ago and gradually adapted to life in the ocean. They are known for their thick fur, which is the densest of any mammal, and their ability to use tools, such as rocks, to open shellfish and other food sources. <a href="sea_otters.html">  Read More...</a></p>
